# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
* Most recent updates were made to project to improve the overall aesthetics with responsiveness on lower and intermiate resolutions. 

**Description**

This is a project about traveling across the US from Portland, ME to Portland, OR on bicycle.  It highlights 5 specific areas, as well as providing photographs from along the way.  The website is responsive and was made using the BEM methodology, coded with primarily HTML and CSS.
